How to build and deploy server and client

Run the following commands:
cd server/
mvn clean package && java -jar target/web-frontend-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
    
Then open localhost:4567 in your browser.

How to develop
You can build the frontend itself and have your changes immediately compiled and reloaded in the browser if you go into the "client" directory and run "npm run dev".  (See client/README.md)  The development server will make itself available at localhost:8080.

Misc. notes
In server/pom.xml, we pull adam_core.jar as a dependency into our Maven project via a "file repository" that was created using the following Maven command:
mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-install-plugin:2.3.1:install-file -Dfile=adam_core.jar -DgroupId=uniolunisaar.adam -DartifactId=adam-core -Dversion=<Version> -Dpackaging=jar -DlocalRepositoryPath=server/adam-core
This is the best practice, according to Pascal Thivent in his answer on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2229757/maven-add-a-dependency-to-a-jar-by-relative-path
